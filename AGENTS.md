# Kinera: instructions for contributors and agents

Kinera is the motion math of the AMAGE UI ecosystem, implemented in **Bend 2**:
easing curves, damped springs and retargetable motion values, evaluated in
closed form from a millisecond clock. Read the README for current capabilities
and limits; a roadmap item (decay, keyframes, laws) is not implemented merely
because it appears in the project scope.

## Implementation

- Implement library logic in Bend 2, rather than wrapping an animation
  library written in another language.
- Kinera is pure: no IO, no window, no clock of its own. The host passes
  `now`. Keep it that way; scheduling frames belongs to Ankra and Voltra.
- Numbers only. Colour mixing belongs to Chromi; drawing and per-control
  transitions belong to Mokko and Kairo.
- Before writing Bend, run `bend version` and read `bend guide` from the
  installed toolchain. Verify available syntax/effects instead of assuming old
  examples work. Base has `F32.exp`, `sin`, `cos` and `sqrt`; Kinera uses them
  directly.
- Every function stays total: clamp or default invalid numbers and document the
  rule in docs/api.md, rather than returning errors an animation cannot use.
- Keep the units fixed: `U32` ms clocks, `F32` ms durations, velocities per
  second.
- Keep source, comments, documentation, and commit messages in English.

## Writing fast Bend

Correct Bend is not fast Bend by default. Measured rules (Bend 2.0.35):

- Indexed, large or hot data (bytes, pixels, coverage, quads) lives in an
  `Array<U32>` (native flat block, ~1 ns/read), not a `List`. Lists are fine
  when tiny, built once and consumed in order. Arrays are affine and cannot be
  fields of `Data` types: keep them local and convert once at the boundary.
- No `do Result`/`do Maybe` binds or callbacks per byte, pixel or glyph: each
  bind is a closure (45% of a measured profile). Thread state through one
  recursive def that matches on the result.
- `||`, `&&` and `Bool.pick` evaluate both sides; use `match` to stop early.
- Never `Array.clone` or append (`List.append`) in a loop; build with a
  reversed accumulator or a tail parameter.
- A parameter that a def only matches or passes to itself is borrowed (no
  refcount); descend trees with the selector as a parameter.
- Keep non-recursive records small (they are passed flattened; the widest one
  widens every call frame). Box big ones with an `Alias{x: T}` constructor.
- Split independent, balanced work of tens of µs or more with a parallel call
  (`a b = f(l) g(r)`); never parallelize tiny or IO-bound work.
- Measure before and after on the same input; print a result before the next
  `IO.now()`.

Here: `value()` is the hot path, called per animated property per frame. It
must stay free of lists, closures and `do` binds, and `Motion` must stay a
small flat record (about a dozen words). Measure `examples/bench.bend` before
and after any change to it; today it costs 4 to 30 ns per call. Hosts with
hundreds of properties should skip motions that are `done` rather than
evaluating them.

## Linux first

The initial goal is excellent behavior on Ian's actual Linux development machine:
correctness, stability, measured performance, and a finished user experience.
Inspect the effective environment before choosing integrations.

Build compatibility layers as the project progresses, after visible, well-made
Linux results. Do not let speculative Windows or macOS abstractions delay local
quality. Introduce abstractions from concrete needs.

## Working practice

- Preserve existing work and keep the library's boundary clear: Kinera maps
  time to numbers; it does not schedule, draw or own colour.
- Pin numeric behavior against an independent reference: compute expected
  values in float64 Python (a throwaway script outside the repository) and
  write them into tests.bend with the tolerance they must meet.
- Favor simple, maintainable code. Pursue fast, polished behavior with
  evidence.
- Compilation is not visual proof. Runtime checks are not proofs of the entire
  system. State partial support and unverified behavior explicitly.
- Every compile takes the shared build lock
  (`flock /tmp/amage-eco-bend-build.lock nice -n 10 bend ...`, or
  `cd ../build && ./eco test kinera-tests`). Take `/tmp/amage-eco-bench.lock`
  while timing. Never kill another session's process.
- Keep generated binaries, logs, crash dumps, credentials, and machine-specific
  evidence out of Git. Stage explicit paths and preserve concurrent changes.
